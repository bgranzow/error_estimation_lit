\section{Nomenclature}

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Normed error estimate}: Let $u$ denote the exact solution to a
PDE and $u^h$ denote a corresponding finite element approximation.
Error estimates are typically of the form $\| u - u^h \| \leq C(h)$,
where $h$ is some characteristic mesh size and $\| \cdot \|$ is a
chosen global norm.
\item \emph{Functional error estimate}: Functional error estimates
are typically written of the form $| J(u) - J(u^h) | \leq C(h)$,
where $J(u)$ denotes some functional quantity of the solution $u$, which
can potentially be localized. Functional error estimates are a more
general type of error estimate that encompass normed error estimates.
\item \emph{A priori error estimation}: In \emph{a priori} error estimation,
the right hand side $C(h)$ of the estimate depends on $h$ and the
exact solution $u$. Its main use is in qualitative analysis, as the exact
solution $u$ is generally unknown. For instance, an error estimate of the
form:
\begin{gather}
\| u - u^h \| _{L^2} \leq ch^2 | u |_{H^2}
\end{gather}
informs us that a reduction in the mesh size by a factor of 2 will reduce
the error by a factor of 4.
\item \emph{A posteriori error estimation}: In \emph{a posteriori} error
estimation, the right hand side $C(h)$ of the estimate depends on $h$
and the exact solution $u^h$. These types of estimates can be further
manipulated into element-wise bounds, which then qualitatively inform
which elements contribute more greatly to the overall error. This information
can then in turn be used for \emph{adaptive} analysis. For instance,
a simple residual-based \emph{a posteriori} error estimate for Poisson's
equation, $- \nabla^2 u = f$, takes the form:
\begin{gather}
\| u - u^h \| _{L^2} \leq c h \| f + \nabla^2u \|,
\end{gather}
whose right-hand side can be integrated by parts to be expressed as a sum of
volumetric contributions from element interiors and jump contributions from
element boundaries.
\item \emph{Error estimator}: An error estimate $\eta_K$ of the form
$\| u - u^h \| \leq \eta_K$ provides a provably true upper bound for the
discretiztion error that reaches a sharp upper bound as the mesh size
$h \to 0$.
\item \emph{Error indicator}: An error indicator $\hat{\eta}_K$ of the
form $\| u - u^h \| \leq \hat{\eta}_K$ is not a \emph{true} upper bound
on the discretization error. Often times such a true \emph{error estimate}
is difficult to find, for instance, due to nonlinearities in the
underlying PDE. Nonetheless, an indicator approximation $\hat{\eta}_K$
to the true upper bound can be made which still qualitatively behaves
correctly and can be used to inform mesh adaptation. The distinction here
is that the indicator $\hat{\eta}_K$ cannot be used to \emph{guarantee}
that the discretization error is below a certain tolerance.
\item \emph{Correction indicator}: A  \emph{correction indicator}
$\tilde{\eta}_K$ which is used to drive mesh adaptation at the element
level and may or may not have any mathematical basis and/or actual relation
to the discretization error itself. For example a heuristic correction
indicator might indicate refinement at the interface between two materials.

\section{Reviews}

\begin{itemize}
\item
\emph{Error estimation and adaptive meshing in strongly nonlinear dynamic
problems} \cite{radovitzky1999error}: The authors develop a framework for
estimating errors in nonlinear solid mechanics problems that are potentially
dynamic. They assume that the material obeys a minimum principle, valid
for a range of material models with an appropriate constitutive update,
and use this minimum principle as the basis for error estimation. They
discretization the PDE in time first and then discretize in space leading
to an equivalent static problem on which error estimation is performed.
They show results for error estimation and mesh adaptation for compressive
waves traveling down a shock tube in three dimensions with an internal
temperature state-variable.
\item
\emph{Adaptive remeshing based on a posteriori error estimation for forging
simulation} \cite{boussetta2006adaptive}: The authors present an approach
mesh adaptation in forging simulations with a viscoplastic material model
using ZZ/SPR-type error estimation. The governing equations do not include
inertial terms.
\item
\emph{Adaptivity based on error estimation for viscoplastic softening
materials}  \cite{diez2000adaptivity}: The authors develop an adaptive
approach for viscoplastic materials by generalizing a residual-type
error estimation procedure. This residual error estimate is split into two
parts: local solves over element interiors and then by solving Dirichlet
problems over patches of elements. Results for quasi-steady problems in
two dimensions with strain-localization are considered.
